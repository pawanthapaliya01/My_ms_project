ðŸ§¬ MS Project: Melting Profile of Helicoidal DNA Molecules

In my Master's project, I investigated the thermal and mechanical melting behavior of helicoidal DNA molecules using an extended Peyrard-Bishop (PB) model. This biophysical model captures the nonlinear dynamics of base pair openings and stacking interactions critical to DNA denaturation.

Key highlights:

    Thermal vs Mechanical Melting:
    The model revealed that:

        Shorter DNA molecules exhibit melting profiles predominantly influenced by mechanical forces.

        Longer DNA molecules are more sensitive to temperature changes, making thermal denaturation a more effective probe for their stability.

    Modeling & Simulation:

        Employed the extended PB model to simulate the helicoidal structure and denaturation pathways.

        Analyzed the energy landscape and melting transitions under varying thermal and mechanical conditions.

    Tools & Languages Used:

        Fortran for numerical simulations.

        Mathematica for symbolic computation and visualization.

        Python for data processing, analysis, and plotting.

This project bridges nonlinear dynamics with molecular biophysics, offering insights into the sequence-length-dependent stability of DNA and providing a framework for further exploration of nucleic acid mechanics.
